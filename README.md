Investigations of the Atmosphere using Cansats


1. Source / Inspiration of Codes
--------------------------------

My work

2. Using the code
-----------------

Neither Openfoam nor Fluidity is required. The base component (Nealbara - named after the ancient ocean around Vaalbara) is the only requirement. With Nealbara, one can load models, solvers, and constraints, and execute them. Everything runs with C/C++ with some python. Any modern Unix machine should be enough to handle this. In fact, I dont plan any support for windows.

GNU GPL V3 copyleft. Fork me at will. But if you do so, let me know, I will be happy.
